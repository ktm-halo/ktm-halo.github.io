        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          For this assignment, I decided to review Rich Brown's personal
          portfolio website, RichBrown.info. The site showcases a range of
          interactive design projects that highlight both his creativity and
          professional skill. In this reflection, I’ll share my experience
          exploring the website—looking at its navigation, animations, and
          overall engagement—to better understand how interactive features can
          effectively communicate design ideas.

      <h2 class="group-title">First Impressions & Actions</h2>
      <section id="first" class="first">
        <h2>First thing noticed</h2>
        <p>
          The first thing I noticed was the clean and minimal layout, combined
          with bold typography and subtle animations. This immediately conveyed
          a sense of professional design and set the tone for the interactive
          experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="actions">
        <h2>Discrete actions in two minutes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Scrolled through the homepage to understand overall layout</li>
          <li>Clicked on several showcased projects to explore details</li>
          <li>
            Read project descriptions and viewed accompanying images and videos
          </li>
          <li>Explored animations and transitions on different pages</li>
          <li>Interacted with the two interactive characters “R” and “B”</li>
          <li>Visited the About and Contact sections</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="engagement">
        <h2>Most time spent engaging</h2>
        <p>
          I spent most of my time exploring the animations and interactive
          elements of each project, appreciating how motion and layout worked
          together to showcase creativity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="common">
        <h2>Most common action</h2>
        <p>
          I frequently clicked on the “R” character in the top-left corner,
          which functions as a back-to-home button, repeatedly returning to the
          homepage after viewing each project.

      <h2 class="group-title">Goals & Communication</h2>
      <section id="goals" class="5">
        <h2>Impression of primary goal</h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal of the website appears to be showcasing Rich Brown's
          design portfolio and interactive projects, highlighting both
          creativity and professional experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="6">
        <h2>How the goal is communicated</h2>
        <p>
          This is achieved through interactive elements, clean and intuitive
          design, clear navigation, engaging animations, and the inclusion of
          images and videos for each project, which together demonstrate Rich
          Brown's design skills firsthand.

      <section id="iot" class="7">
        <h2>Impression of how it should be interacted with over time</h2>
        <p>
          In my opinion, each visit to the website is likely intended to be
          short, around five minutes, to quickly browse a few projects or check
          the site’s functionality. However, users are encouraged to return
          multiple times to explore projects in more detail and to see new
          updates over time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="8">
        <h2>How the experience communicates this</h2>
        <p>
          The site communicates this through preview images and summaries for
          each project, allowing users to quickly scan and decide which projects
          to explore further. The variety of projects, combined with unique
          interactive elements on each page, encourages multiple visits and
          gradual exploration over time.

      <h2 class="group-title">References, Feelings & Evaluation</h2>
      <section id="rfe" class="9">
        <h2>Other media forms referenced</h2>
        <p>
          The site references other digital media forms such as portfolio
          galleries, interactive animations, and case studies, which are typical
          in UX/UI design presentations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="10">
        <h2>How this affects user actions</h2>
        <p>
          These references suggest that users should interact deliberately,
          clicking through individual projects while paying close attention to
          graphic details, animations, and overall site structure.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="11">
        <h2>How this affects user feelings</h2>
        <p>
          The experience communicates a sense of curiosity and engagement,
          motivating me to explore and fully appreciate the creativity and
          thoughtfulness behind each project.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="12">
        <h2>Most frustrating part</h2>
        <p>
          Some animations take slightly longer to load, which can disrupt the
          browsing flow. Additionally, certain interactive details require the
          user to guess how to interact, which enhances aesthetic value but may
          reduce immediate usability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="13">
        <h2>Most satisfying part</h2>
        <p>
          The smooth motion, clear transitions, and animated presentation of
          images and videos are the most satisfying elements. They create a
          visually pleasing and engaging experience, making the interactive
          exploration enjoyable and memorable.
